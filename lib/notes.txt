Creation of classes: 
-The first letter of the name must be uppercase.
-No spaces to be left between two or more words.
-The words can be separated using only underscores.

Creation of variables:
-Variable names must be in lowercase.
-Variable names must not be the same as class names.

Use final
-when you need variables that cannot be reassigned but can be computed at runtime

Use Const
-when you know the values at compile time to enhance performance and ensure immutability

Use Var 
-when you need a mutable variable that needs to be updated
